## WALKING RUNNING CLASSIFICATION PROJECT
### create model for classify whether person running or walking

#### Introduction
In the age of wearable technology, motion sensors have become integral to tracking and analyzing human activity. These sensors provide valuable data that can be used to distinguish between various physical activities such as walking and running. The ability to accurately classify these activities has significant applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and even medical diagnostics.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify human activity—specifically, walking or running—based on motion sensor data. The dataset utilized for this project contains readings from sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, which capture the motion of individuals as they engage in these activities. By leveraging this data, the project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately identify whether a person is walking or running.

#### Objective
Data Analysis: Explore and understand sensor data patterns.
Model Development: Build and evaluate models to classify walking vs. running.
Model Comparison: Identify the best-performing model.
